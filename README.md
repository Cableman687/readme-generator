# README Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to: Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Reading/Writing Files and others.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.
- This application allows the user to save time otherwise spent creating a README, and automates many of the file structuring and layout requirements for a high quality README.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for any given project.?
